                In order for research into COVID-19 to be carried out consistently across the 
                whole of the UK, it is important that the research community is open and 
                transparent about how the condition has been defined for research. We enhanced 
                the Phenotype Portal to provide a comprehensive, open-access resource providing 
                the research community with information, tools and phenotyping algorithms for 
                defining COVID-19 related phenotypes in UK electronic health records (EHR). The 
                Portal currently hosts 336 phenotyping phenotypes, 909 codelists and curates 
                25000 controlled clinical terminology terms. Many of the disease conditions 
                covered in the Portal are from conditions which have been flagged as high-risk 
                in relation to COVID-19 such as cancer, chemotherapy, immunosuppression and 
                others.

                Vulnerable people, including people aged over 70 and those who have high blood 
                pressure, heart disease or asthma, make up 20 per cent of the British 
                population. Early models of population mortality during the COVID pandemic did 
                not include information on such common high-risk conditions or their 
                longer-term pre-COVID-19 mortality. Researchers at UCL, Oxford and Cambridge 
                estimated the excess number of deaths over one year under different COVID-19 
                incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and 
                differing mortality impacts for different relative risks for the disease. The 
                study used linked electronic health records of 3.8M people from England and the 
                Health Data Research (HDR) UK-CALIBER open online portal to define underlying 
                conditions at different ages in women and men. Findings show that the risk of 
                death from COVID-19 for someone with heart disease is five times higher than a 
                healthy person and 10 times higher for someone with heart disease and diabetes.

                cancer service provision and model excess deaths in the COVID-19 emergency in 
                patients with cancer and other underlying health conditions. Researchers 
                estimated there could be 6,270 more deaths among newly diagnosed cancer 
                patients over the next year - a 20% increase in deaths among people newly 
                diagnosed with cancer. This number could rise to an estimated 17,915 additional 
                deaths if all people currently living with cancer are considered. More than 
                three quarters of these excess deaths will occur in people who are also 
                suffering from one or more other underlying health condition, including 
                cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, obesity and diabetes. Dr Alvina Lai,

                In response to the UK Government Chief Medical Officer's announcements on 16 
                and 22 March 2020 on underlying conditions we wanted to identify an 
                individual's risk of dying based on their underlying conditions using the best 
                possible evidence. This is important to help people understand how government 
                policies around 'social distancing' affect them. We also wanted to find out how 
                COVID-19 will affect the health system by estimating the number of excess 
                deaths which might occur due to COVID-19.
