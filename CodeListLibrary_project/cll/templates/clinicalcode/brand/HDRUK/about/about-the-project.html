              </h3>
              <p>
                Welcome to HDR UK National Phenomics Resource Project, a project
                funded by Health Data Research UK.
              </p>
              <p>
                When patients interact with physicians, or are admitted into hospital,
                information is collected electronically on their symptoms, diagnoses,
                laboratory test results, and prescriptions. This information is stored
                securely in Electronic Health Records (EHR) and is a valuable resource
                for researchers and clinicians for improving health and healthcare.
                EHRs are however of variable detail and quality and contain many
                inconsistencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result, researchers and data providers spend
                considerable time creating complex computer programs to fix and
                statistically analyse the information in EHR and identify which
                patients have which disease. Currently, there is no means to share
                these tools across institutions in the UK resulting in duplication of
                effort. Reproducibility of research is also hampered as others do not
                have access to the precise methods and definitions used in a particular
                study. This project addresses these issues by creating an open resource
                for EHR users (researchers, clinicians, the NHS and data providers) to
                share their methods.

                What is Phenomics?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Phenomics refers to the science of deriving new knowledge for health
                by studying multiple conditions in new ways. This involves studying
                all currently recognized diseases - so called 'phenome wide'
                approaches. In order to do this efficiently phenomics approaches
                require the creation of computable definitions of diseases, health
                states and traits, including temporal components of these (i.e. change
                and rate of change over time). It covers the full spectrum of health
                and disease across the entire life course and is relevant to a wide
                range of potential stakeholders and beneficiaries.

                The Challenge
              </h3>
              <p>
                A primary reason for using data from EHR is the creation of phenotype
                algorithms to identify disease status, onset and progression.
                Phenotyping (describing the characteristics of disease) however is
                challenging as the data are collected for different purposes, have
                variable data quality and often require significant harmonisation.
                While considerable effort goes into these algorithms, there is no
                consistent methodology for creating and evaluating them and no
                centralised repository for depositing and sharing them.

                The Solution
              </h3>
              <p>
                We will create a national library for dissemination of citable
                algorithms (incl. validations) and tools which will reduce duplication
                of effort and improve research reproducibility. We will explore
                methods for creating computable representations of algorithms for
                integration into actionable analytics for healthcare. Finally, we will
                fundamentally shift the EHR cultural landscape by a robust
                incentivisation programme, providing guidelines on best practices,
                cross-disciplinary training, and ensuring alignment with other
                international initiatives.

                Impact and Outcomes
              </h3>
              <p>
                Through this project, we will deliver a fundamental step-change in the
                current EHR community in the UK by bringing together health data
                scientists, clinicians, computer scientists, public health experts and
                data curators under the FAIR principles (www.force11.org). The
                National Phenomics Resource will facilitate the dissemination and
                re-use of algorithms, tools and methods by the community. By
                establishing a national standard for creating, evaluating and
                representing phenotypes, we will accelerate the impact of discovery
                through increased transparency and replicability and maximise the
                usability and value of existing data repositories to new users.
                Finally, we will take the first steps towards establishing
                computational biomedical knowledge objects (e.g. guidelines with
                embedded phenotypes endorsed by NICE) which will enable the creation
                of actionable health analytics in the NHS.

              </h3>
              <p>
                The Library contains definitions for hundreds of diseases from
                structured and unstructured data sources including mobile devices and
                wearables. For each phenotype, the library curates its metadata,
                implementation details, code and validation information, and enables
                reproducible and transparent research by the wider research and
                clinical community. National research initiatives can curate and
                showcase their algorithms through bespoke "collection" pages such as
                BREATHE (respiratory phenotypes collated by the HDR UK Hub for
                Respiratory Health for use in research) and the British Heart
                Foundation Data Science Centre phenotypes. Finally, the Phenotype
                Library is cross-linked to the HDR UK Innovation Gateway to enable
                discovery of tools and maximise the usability and value of existing
                data repositories to the research community.

              </h3>
              <p>
                A primary use-case for EHR is the creation of phenotyping algorithms
                used to identify disease status, onset and progression or extraction
                of information on risk factors or biomarkers. These complex
                algorithms can enable researchers to extract information from EHR,
                statistically analyze it and use the findings to improve human
                health. While considerable effort goes into creating these
                algorithms, there is no consistent methodology for creating and
                evaluating them and no centralised repository for depositing and
                sharing them.

                  The Library stores phenotyping algorithms, metadata and tools
                  only. No data are stored in the Library.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ideally, phenotypes that are deposited in the Library will have
                  undergone some form of peer-review to assess validity and quality
                  either through peer-reviewed publication or some other means of
                  sharing the definition(s).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Phenotype definitions will be assigned a unique Digital Object
                  Identifier (DOI) to facilitate identification of the phenotype.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All material deposited in the Library remain the intellectual
                  property of the research group who created the phenotype(s) - the

                  The aim of the Library is not to standardize or harmonize disease
                  definitions, therefore several phenotypes may be stored for the

                Short term - we are currently working on expanding the Phenotype

                critical care (PIONEER) and cancer (DATA-CAN), ClinicalCodes.org and
