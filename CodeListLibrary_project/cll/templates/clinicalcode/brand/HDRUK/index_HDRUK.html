            The Phenotype Library is accessible via an API to support interoperability, is integrated with health dataset information in HDR-UK's Innovation Gateway, 
            and hosts content from numerous contributing organisations.

            The Library is enabling important research to improve patient health and well-being. Content spans major disease areas, including heart disease, cancer, 
            COVID-19 and other common and rare human health conditions.
            Curated collections from contributors such as the HDR UK BREATHE Hub for respiratory health share clinical expertise to tackle critical research questions.

            Built with a focus on computability, this resource aims to drive the next generation of research methods. Integration with Phenoflow enables executable 
            implementations of the phenotypes in our collection, while the API and R package client facilitate integration of the Library content directly into 
            other analysis workflows.

      <h3>What is a phenotyping algorithm?</h3>
      <p>
        A phenotype is a observable and measurable piece of information that is relevant to health or healthcare.
        For example, it can be a disease (<em>e.g.</em> type 2 diabetes), a blood pressure measurement, a blood sugar value or a prescription of antibiotics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Phenotyping algorithms are special tools that enable researchers to extract phenotypes from complex, and often messy data that 
        get generated during routine interactions within the healthcare system.
        They identify and extract data from medical records using clinical codes which are the building block of how information is recorded 
        in healthcare (for example ICD-10). Using these specialized algorithms, researchers and clinicians can maximize the value of patient 
        data contained in medical records and answer important questions that can improve health and healthcare.

      <h3>How are we enabling this work?</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>HDR UK Phenotype Library</strong> is a platform to host phenotyping algorithms and harness their power for research.
        Our aim is to provide researchers with the “GitHub of phenotyping”: an open platform for <strong>creation, storage,
        dissemination, re-use, evaluation, and citation</strong> of curated algorithms and metadata. Our goal is for this to be a
        place where researchers can share their own work, benefit from what others have shared, and even build new
        collaborations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a funded project of <a href="https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/projects/national-phenomics-resource/">HDRUK</a>, our primary goal is to develop a national platform supporting researchers within
        the United Kingdom, but we don’t want to stop there: we welcome contributions from members of the health
        research community worldwide.
