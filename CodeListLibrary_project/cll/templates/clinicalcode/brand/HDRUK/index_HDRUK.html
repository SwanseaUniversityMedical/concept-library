   <!--<h2 class="header-design">Welcome to the Concept Library</h2>
      <p>The concept library is a system for storing, managing, sharing, and documenting clinical code lists in health research. The specific goals of this work are
         storing code lists along with metadata that captures important information about quality, author and
         storing version history and provide a way to unambiguously reference a particular version of a code list,
         allowing programmatic interaction with code lists via an API, so that they can be directly used in queries, statistical scripts, etc.
         A key goal would also be to provide a mechanism for sharing code lists between projects and organizations.

               <div class="paddingText">
                  A phenotype is a observable and measurable piece of information that is relevant to health or healthcare. For example, it can be a disease (e.g. type 2 diabetes), a blood pressure measurement, a blood sugar value or a prescription of antibiotics. Phenotyping algorithms are special tools that enable researchers to extract phenotypes from complex, and often messy data that get generated during routine interactions within the healthcare system. They identify and extract data from medical records using clinical codes which are the building block of how information is recorded in healthcare (for example ICD-10). Using these specialized algorithms, researchers and clinicians can maximize the value of patient data contained in medical records and answer important questions that can improve health and healthcare.

                  The <b>HDR UK Phenotype Library</b> is a platform to host phenotyping algorithms and harness their power for research. Our aim is to provide researchers with the "GitHub of phenotyping": an open platform for
                  <b>creation, storage, dissemination, re-use, evaluation, and citation </b>of curated algorithms and metadata. Our goal is for this to be a place where researchers can share their own work, benefit from what others have shared, and even build new collaborations.
