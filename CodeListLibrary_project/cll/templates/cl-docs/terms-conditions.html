            This section relates to the collection, handling and storage of data we obtain from
            individuals who work with HDR UK, either those directly employed by SAIL or those
            who work with SAIL data to undertake research projects. It does not relate to the de-
            identified data held within the SAIL Databank itself. For this, please see the section
            regarding patients and the public.
            For the purposes of collecting, processing and storing data from individuals
            employed by or working with SAIL, Swansea University is the Data Controller and is
            committed to protecting the rights of individuals in line with the Data Protection Act
            1998 (DPA) and the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

            i. SAIL staff

            <p>
            Individuals directly employed within the Data Science Building at Swansea
            University, whose role is entirely or partly to support the SAIL Databank core
            services and infrastructure are considered SAIL staff. Various departments within
            Swansea University (e.g. Human Resources, Finance) hold personal data on
            employees. This is collected and held under the individual’s contract of employment,
            and is used for the purposes of managing the individual’s contract of employment.

            ii. Project researchers’ contacts
            </div>
            <p>
            These are individuals whose work is directly related to using the data held within the
            SAIL databank, and who provide personal information to SAIL as part of their
            applications to use SAIL data. This data is initially held under specific, explicit and
            recorded consent, and later as part of the terms of the contract governing the
            research project being undertaken with SAIL. The following personal information will
            be held:

            <li style="  list-style-type: circle;">Name and job title.</li>
            <li style="  list-style-type: circle;">Email address.</li>
            <li style="  list-style-type: circle;">Curriculum vitae.</li>
            <li style="  list-style-type: circle;">Evidence of Safe Researcher training or equivalent having been completed.</li>
            <li style="  list-style-type: circle;">The name of your organisation, institution or place of work.</li>
            <br>
            All data held within the SAIL Databank has been provided by third party Data
            Owners, who impose a number of information governance conditions on use of their
            data, to ensure that it is appropriate and in the public interest. Part of these
            conditions are that individuals given access to the data are named, professional
            researchers with appropriate skills and training. The personal data we collect and
            hold from researchers is mainly to satisfy these information governance
            requirements and to demonstrate continued compliance them to any audit
            undertaken during or after the project lifecycle. We also use researchers contact
            details to contact them throughout the life of their project to inform them of their
            project’s status, report any downtime in access to data and other administrative
            functions required to allow us to set up and manage their project. Researchers
            should be aware that if consent to hold personal data is withdrawn, this will result in
            the individual being unable to continue to access SAIL data, since we will no longer
            hold sufficient information to demonstrate their compliance with our information
            governance requirements.

            of their access to SAIL data, then archived for a period of five years (to comply with
