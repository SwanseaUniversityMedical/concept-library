To run all the tests you need to run THREE commands:
    - python manage.py test  --noinput 
    - python manage.py test  --noinput clinicalcode.tests.functional_tests.read_only
    - python manage.py test  --noinput clinicalcode.tests.unit_tests.read_only

The first one will run all the tests except read only tests. It is necessary  because normal tests will take settings from settings.py
The second one runs READ_ONLY tests. It takes settings from read_only_test_settings.py. Read_only tests must take settings from read_only_test_settings.py otherwise they will fail.

manage.py manage which settings file is read. If a command contains read_only phrase then it reads read_only_test_settings.py otherwise settings.py



To test:

Go into the webapp docker container: `docker exec -it concept-library-dev-db_webapp_1 /bin/bash`

Load the environment: `source /var/www/concept_lib_sites/v1/cllvirenv_v1/bin/activate`

Go into the project folder: `cd /var/www/concept_lib_sites/v1/CodeListLibrary_project`

Execute the tests: `python manage.py test --noinput`
