    <h1>Permissions</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <h2 id=3D"Permissions-Summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Permissions apply only to the Concept-level items, currently Code Lists =
or Working Sets.</p>
<p>There are 3 levels of permission: none, view and edit.</p>
<p>Permission can be granted to 3 =E2=80=98actors=E2=80=99: one user (the o=
wner), one group or all users.</p>
<p>Owner can always edit. This can't be changed, but the fact that the owne=
r can edit is displayed.</p>
<p>Only the owner can edit permissions.</p>
<p>The owner can assign ownership to a different user. All user names are d=
isplayed to select from, but this might need to change in the future for se=
curity reasons. Not necessary for version 1.</p>
<p><span style=3D"letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Default access (when creating a n=
ew Concept-level item) is edit permission for the owner and no access for a=
 group or for everyone.</span></p>
<p>A super-user (admin user) has (edit) permission to everything and can se=
e all elements.</p>
<p>In addition, there are functions (<strong>allowed_to_create</strong> and=
 <strong>allowed_to_permit</strong>) which control access to certain applic=
ation functionality: the ability to create and the ability to change the pe=
rmissions. These are not determined by the permissions settings, but by the=
 application settings and whether the user is the owner of the item.</p>
<p>If permissions to a concept are revoked, anything that refers to that co=
ncept becomes unusable (no export/API access), and the fact that the concep=
t is no longer available is highlighted with an error message.</p>
<p>Groups and group membership are set manually by super users using Django=
 functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p><s>It is possible to deny permission to everyone (owner included) but no=
t super-users. This apparently odd option has been left as it allows a user=
 to shutdown their concept if their user ID has been compromised. This acti=
on can be reversed by a super-user.</s></p>
<p><s>It is possible for an owner to deny themselves permission whilst prov=
iding it to a group or to everyone. This makes it possible to effectively p=
rovide group ownership to the Concept. However, at present it may only be p=
ossible to change ownership if you are the owner, so once done, this may on=
ly be undone by a super-user.</s></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size: 20.0px;letter-spacing: -0.008em;">Implementati=
on</span></p>
<pre>The permission code is implemented in clinicalcode/permissions.py.</pr=
e>
<p>Permissions are checked using one of four checks, two of which have asso=
ciated validation functions. There are six Mixin classes which are used to =
prevent the dispatch of the page response if permission is withheld. In add=
ition, permissions are used to produce lists of visible elements. These fun=
ctions are intended only to implement access according to the permission se=
ttings. They are not intended to describe (in)visibility for other reasons,=
 for example, if the concept is deleted, where it is expected that the perm=
itted list will later be reduced by excluding deleted items where appropria=
te.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Permissions-Checks&amp;Validation">Checks &amp; Validation</h3>
<p>In all cases, a super-user, is allowed without further checks.</p>
<p>'<strong>allowed_to_create</strong>', will return FALSE if:</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">(i) the&nbsp;settings.CLL_READ_ONLY is se=
t to TRUE.</p>
<p>=E2=80=98<strong>allowed_to_view</strong>=E2=80=99, for a single item wh=
ich returns TRUE if:</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">(i) there is view or edit permission to e=
veryone, or</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">(ii) there is view or edit permission to =
the owner and the current user is the owner, or</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">(iii) there is view or edit permission to=
 any group which contains the current user.</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">The function =E2=80=98<strong>validate_ac=
cess_to_view</strong>=E2=80=99, will raise an exception if not allowed to v=
iew.</p>
<p>=E2=80=98<strong>allowed_to_edit</strong>=E2=80=99, for a single item wh=
ich returns TRUE if:</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">(i) there is edit permission to everyone,=
 or</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">(ii) there is edit permission to the owne=
r and the current user is the owner, or</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">(iii) there is edit permission to any gro=
up which contains the current user.</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">This function will always return FALSE if=
 the settings.CLL_READ_ONLY is set to TRUE.</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">The function =E2=80=98<strong>validate_ac=
cess_to_edit</strong>=E2=80=99, will raise an exception if not allowed to e=
dit.</p>

es a list of all the child code lists of a code list or working set and ret=
urns TRUE if:</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;">(i) permission to view or edit is granted=
 to all of the child code lists.</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: 30.0px;"><br></p>
<p><span style=3D"font-size: 16.0px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: -0.00=
6em;">Mixin Classes</span></p>
<p>There are Mixin classes for view and edit access to both code lists and =
working sets and parent code lists and working sets. There is also a Mixin =
for creation of anything (including forks which also have the edit Mixin). =
These classes block the dispatch function of the containing class.</p>
<h3 id=3D"Permissions-ListsofVisibleElements">Lists of Visible Elements</h3=
>
<p>There is a set of functions that produces lists of visible elements. Sin=
ce only Concept-level elements have permission attributes, only concepts (o=
ld term) and working sets can be accessed directly by checking their attrib=
ute. Other elements are deemed visible if they are contained in an element =
which has permission:</p>
<p>(i) codes (old term)</p>
<ol>
<li>All the codes associated with the visible code lists (old term, see (ii=
)), or</li>
<li>All the codes associated with a specified code list (old term, see (ii)=
).</li>
</ol>
<p>(ii) code lists (old term)</p>
<ol>
<li>All the code lists contained in the visible components (see (iii)), or<=
/li>
<li>The specified code list if it is contained in the visible components (s=
ee (iii)).</li>
</ol>
<p>(iii) components (old term)</p>
<ol>
<li>All components which are contained in concepts which the user is allowe=
d to view (see (iv)), or</li>
<li>The component associated with a specified code list (old term) if conta=
ined in a concept which the user is allowed to view (see (iv)).</li>
</ol>
<p>(iv) concepts (old term)</p>

<li>All concepts which have view or edit permission to everyone, view or ed=
it permission to the user and the user is the owner, or view or edit permis=
